- Standard Library (re, random, datetime)

## ✨ Features

### 💬 Conversational Features
- **Name Memory**: Remembers and recalls your name throughout the conversation
- **Personalized Greetings**: Tailored responses based on user information
- **Context Awareness**: Tracks conversation topics and message count
- **Emotional Intelligence**: Detects and responds to emotions (happy, sad, angry, tired)

### 🧮 Utilities
- **Math Calculator**: Perform basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)
- **Time & Date**: Get current time and date information
- **Weather Simulation**: Simulated weather predictions
- **Statistics Tracker**: View conversation statistics

### 🎮 Interactive Games
- **Number Guessing Game**: Guess a number between 1-10 (3 attempts)
- **Coin Flip**: Random heads or tails
- **Dice Roll**: Roll a 6-sided die

### 🎭 Entertainment
- **Jokes**: Programming and tech-related humor
- **Riddles**: Brain teasers with clever answers
- **Random Facts**: Interesting tech and programming trivia
- **Motivational Quotes**: Inspirational messages for coders
- **Compliments**: Encouraging and positive messages

### 🗣️ Natural Conversation
- **Multiple Response Variations**: Diverse replies to avoid repetition
- **Question Handling**: Responds appropriately to user queries
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Basic positive/negative sentiment detection
- **Politeness Recognition**: Responds to thanks, apologies, etc.

🤖 Chatbot: Hello! I'm an advanced chatbot. Type 'bye' or 'exit' to end our chat.
============================================================

You: Hi
🤖 Chatbot: Hello there! What's your name?

You: My name is Alex
🤖 Chatbot: Nice to meet you, Alex! I'll remember your name.

You: Tell me a joke
🤖 Chatbot: Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs! 🐛
```

I'm angry                 # Calming response
I'm tired                 # Supportive response
```

## 🔧 How It Works

### Core Components

#### 1. **Input Processing**
```python
user_input = input("\nYou: ").strip()
user_input_lower = user_input.lower()
```
- Captures user input
- Normalizes text (lowercase, removes extra spaces)

#### 2. **Pattern Matching**
```python
if 'calculate' in user_input_lower:
    # Math operation logic
elif 'joke' in user_input_lower:
    # Joke response
```
- Uses keyword detection
- Implements if-elif-else chains
- Matches patterns with `in` operator and regex

#### 3. **State Management**
```python
user_name = None
conversation_count = 0
topics_discussed = []
```
- Maintains conversation context
- Tracks user information
- Monitors conversation flow

#### 4. **Response Generation**
```python
responses = [
    "Response 1",
    "Response 2",
    "Response 3"
]
print(f"🤖 Chatbot: {random.choice(responses)}")
```
- Multiple response variations
- Random selection for natural conversation
- Personalized responses using stored data

### NLP Techniques Used

1. **Text Normalization**: Converting input to lowercase
2. **Keyword Extraction**: Identifying important words
3. **Pattern Matching**: Using regex for complex patterns
4. **Sentiment Analysis**: Basic emotion detection
5. **Context Tracking**: Maintaining conversation state
6. **Response Variation**: Avoiding repetitive answers
